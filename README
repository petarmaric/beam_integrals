About
=====

Console app and Python API for determining beam integrals of all 6 supported
beam types, as described in [Milasinovic1997]_. This is a reengineered, advanced
version of our `previous work`_.

This work is a part of the investigation within the research projects:
[ON174027]_ and [TR36017]_, supported by the Ministry for Science and
Technology, Republic of Serbia. This support is gratefully acknowledged.
