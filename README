About
=====

Console app and Python API for determining beam integrals of all 6 supported
beam types, as described in [Milasinovic1997]_. This is a reengineered, advanced
version of our `previous work`_.

This work is a part of the investigation within the research projects:
[ON174027]_ and [TR36017]_, supported by the Ministry for Science and
Technology, Republic of Serbia. This support is gratefully acknowledged.

`Continuous integration`_ is powered by `Jenkins`_.

Installation
============

To install beam_integrals run::

    $ pip install beam_integrals

It's strongly recommended to install `gmpy`_. Without it code will still run
correctly, but much slower at high precision.

.. _`gmpy`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmpy


Console app usage
=================

Quick start::

    $ beam_integrals <subcomand> ...

Show help::

    $ beam_integrals help


Python API usage
================

Quick start::

    >>> from beam_integrals.beam_types import FreeFreeBeam
    >>> from beam_integrals.integrals import I1, integrate
    >>> integrate(I1(), FreeFreeBeam(), a=1., m=1, n=1, error=True)
